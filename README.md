# Table To Bingosync
TableToBingosync is a Java-powered tool for turning ordinary tables into [Bingosync](https://bingosync.com/) boards quickly and easily. it was created to be as simple and easy to use as possible, provided you do know how to use it; instructions on how to use it are listed below. For programmers, the code is probably over-documented for its size, but the documentation helps to teach you how the program works for making edits.

## GUI:
Here is a quick look at the main interface:<br>

1. This is the input pane where you paste the table you want to convert to json format. Commas and tabs will be interpreted as box separators while new lines and semi-colons will be interpreted as row separators.
2. This is the output pane where the converted text will go. After conversion you may still make edits and copy it to bingosync to use as a custom board.
3. This is the character that will replace any empty spaces in the final output table when it is created. To change the character, click on the button and press a key on your keyboared.
4. These are the radio buttons.
5. This is the convert button.
